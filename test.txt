# Quick readme

- you need to find a concourse instance or create one. using docker-compose it's 
pretty simple!
- to add the pipeline to concourse run
  `fly -t quantcli set-pipeline --pipeline xbench --config benchmark_pipeline.yaml -l secrets.yml`
- note to start up openstack machines, you need to have a `secrets.yml` file that contains
  the correct password and user name. E.g.:

  ```
  os_pass: xyz
  os_user: abc
  ```
